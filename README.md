Created a responsive prototype from the provided figma using CSS, flexbox and grid, and bootstrap.

Peer review: David Monterrosa
Comments: While structurally your project does a good job of imitating the layout and it is somewhat responsive, there appear to be significant differences from the prototype. Firstly, the navbar logo is slghtly to close to the left. I recommend playing with padding and margins to fix this. The offcanvas menu should be justified center, but is justified to the left. Also the offcanvas starts from the left in your project, but it should start from the end and push across the screen. For all of your images, try to use the aspect ratio property, because many of the images get warped as the screen size changes. Also pay close attention to the cropping of the images some your images are slightly off. With each section of cards, be careful to adjust the margins. Also at tablet view, the start cooking images begin to overlap. Great job with the best sellers section. Maybe consider going down to one column at a slighty larger screen size, as the tablet view is squished a bit awkwardly. Great job with teh review section, just remember to adjust your images to avoid stretching and warping. The footer needs some work, it only uses one half of the available screen space, see if you can get it to spread out a bit. The footer appears to use a combination of bootstrap and grid.
